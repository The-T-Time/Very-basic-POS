# Very-basic-POS
Terminal, pygame, and tkinter versions. 

Terminal and pygame version will not be updated.
Tkinter will be updated once and a while.

When I say very basic, I mean very basic.
There is no payment method. If I get a card reader Ill code it in but I dont have a way to code it in and test it.
So without it this is basicly a nonfuctioning POS.

What does each version do:

    Terminal version:
    Asks what you want from the menu
    Asks for tip
    prints receipt

    pygame version:
    Does wht the Terminal version does
    able to take things off of choosen items 
    Mouse and keyboard friendly

    tkinter version:
    Exactly the same as the pygame version but a library that is more suited for it
